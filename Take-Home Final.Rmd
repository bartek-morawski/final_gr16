y = as.numeric(CancerType == 'KIRC')

```{r}
# Question 3
y = as.numeric(CancerType == 'KIRC')

# 3a)
fit <- lm(formula = y ~ GeneExp$Gene15)
# 3b) 
summary(fit) 

# Question 3ii
#a) The estimated coefficient is -0.073684
#b) the p value associated with the coefficiant for Gene15 is  1.1*10^-15
#c) The null hypthoesis is that this  coefficient is equal to zero.
#d) Based on the p-value we can reject the null hypothesis as the estimated result does not equal zero. 

#Question 3iii
# B0 = .599268
# B1 = -0.073684
